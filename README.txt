This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run a full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
